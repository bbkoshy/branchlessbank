# Research for Branchless Bank iOS Mobile App

The core purpose of this project is to create a mobile app for the Branchless Bank. Technology is moving at a rapid place. As a growing business, it is our responsibility to keep up with the growing demand. In fact, research indicates that 41% of people are browsing goods and services from their mobile phones. 

### **The goals of the company are to:**
