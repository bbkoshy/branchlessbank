# branchlessbank

##**Creative Brief:**

Objectives: The goal of this project is to create a mobile app for Branchless Bank. We have built a reputable business from the ground up on the basis of transparency and trustworthiness. Now that we've gained our clients' trust, let's make life a little easier for them. By creating a mobile app, we are essentially making our services more accessible and convenient. Who doesn't love convenience and efficiency?

Purpose: To meet our customers where they are and to surpass our competitors in meeting the needs of clients. We believe this is best done through the creation of a mobile app.

Target Audience: 41% of users who now access goods and services from a business through their mobile phones. The goal is to draw more of these users to our bank through the creation of this mobile app.
We will communicate the arrival of this mobile app through advertisements on social media sites, commercials, and ads placed on our desktop site so that current clients also know that this service is now available to them.

Since 41% of people span a variety of classifications, we need to create user personas for the mobile app so that we can begin to intuitively foresee issues and meet needs before they are presented. We want to make sure we make this app easy to use across diverse populations.

Focus: Transparency. Since transparency is the main value we built our business on, we need to make sure that shines through in our mobile app. The mobile app needs to make account information as easy to access as possible. This means, we make the experience to access information regarding past transactions and current information about balances easy to navigate and intuitive. Clients should have the ability to dispute any charges on their account with the click of a button. None of our competitors currently offer this functionality.

End Result: In the end, we should have a polished mobile app that allows users to log in with one touch. They should be able to sync their apps with the one touch feature on their phones. The user should be able to have an aerial view of their transactions month to month. If the client wishes, they should be able to view a pie chart of where they spent the most money during a specific month. Users should be able to deposit checks remotely as this is something our competitors, Bank of America, Chase, and Wells Fargo all offer. The user should be able to set up Bill Pay on this mobile app and get notifications 48 hours in advance to money being taken out of their account. This way, if anything changes, they have ample time and opportunity to update their account.
